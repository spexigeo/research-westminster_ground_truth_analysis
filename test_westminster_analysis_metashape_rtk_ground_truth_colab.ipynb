        "1. **Data Loading**: Load images and GCPs from CSV\n",
        "2. **GCP Conversion**: Convert UTM coordinates to WGS84 lat/lon for MetaShape\n",
        "3. **Orthomosaic Creation**: Generate orthomosaics with and without GCPs using MetaShape\n",
        "4. **Basemap Comparison**: Download basemaps and quantify absolute accuracy\n",
        "5. **Quality Report**: Generate comprehensive comparison report\n",
